Functions file

To discuss :
Begin with execution ? (easier for parsing)
Codes d'erreur, return status

if token starts with '/' '.', do not look through PATH. 
Otherwise search through path (then access to see if it is an executable or not.) 
If access does not find anything, check character in front to see if it is supposed to be a file

Parse environment, formattage (unexistant infile, pipe leading nowhere, unclosed "....), error in execve 
Make sure what we are doing is asked for, avoid unnecessary work
