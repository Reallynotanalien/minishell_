How to identify builtins ? (with first array of each command tab)
Tester les str vides (1ère chose à faire après remove_spaces/au début de remove_spaces)
How to merge only one file
Study printf/gnl

Functions file

To discuss :
Begin with execution ? (easier for parsing)
Codes d'erreur, return status

if token starts with '/' '.', do not look through PATH. 
Otherwise search through path (then access to see if it is an executable or not.) 
If access does not find anything, check character in front to see if it is supposed to be a file

Parse environment, formattage (unexistant infile, pipe leading nowhere, unclosed "....), error in execve 
Make sure what we are doing is asked for, avoid unnecessary work

current working directory of a process affects the relative path
Add #include <sys/types.h> #include <unistd.h> to .h (for stat function)
When a string is returned by a function (ex : ttyname, strerror), it should be copied for storage and editing.
