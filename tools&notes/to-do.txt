- Static struct function to initiate, set to 0 and keep the main variables. (+ Add struct to .h)
- Exit + clean function (Cleans struct, prints message if necessary and exits)
- Printf flag (for debugging)
- Error flag (To catch errors before execution)
- Here doc 
- To check file
- To test file
- Test Excel file audit to choose which test are the most relevant and add them to the test file
- Create a team in the intra
- Tokenisation (to be separated in smaller tasks)
- Linked list functions
- Separate all the .h to have one for each part of the project and one main one
- Signals function
- Choose which Libft we are taking
- Command history (add history, redisplay, replace)
- Decide on what the main struct will be for the execution
- Add minishell into the .gitignore file
